        <h2>Hiüñê!This is Richa Mishra</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently studying in 2nd year, B.Tech CSE, IET Lucknow. This is my portfolio website prepared using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
            <br>
            I am a dedicated UI/UX designer driven by a profound passion for blending creativity with functionality. This fascination led me to pursue a career where I could not only express my creativity but also make a tangible impact on how users interact with digital interfaces.
            <br><br>
            As I continue to evolve in this dynamic field, I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. I am constantly learning from industry trends, experimenting with new design techniques, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in UI/UX design. My goal is to continue creating meaningful experiences that leave a lasting impression on users and clients alike.
            <br><br>
            I am eagerly looking for all possible opportunities on my way. Being a dedicated, disciplined and a team guy, I would definitely be an asset for the organization.<br><br>
            Thank You for letting me have an opportunity to build something extraordinarily great stuff with you people !!!
